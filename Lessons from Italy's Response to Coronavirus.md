# Lessons from Italy’s Response to Coronavirus
# 意大利应对冠状病毒的经验教训
### by Gary P. Pisano , Raffaella Sadun and Michele Zanini

As policymakers around the world struggle to combat the rapidly escalating Covid-19 pandemic, they find themselves in uncharted territory. Much has been written about the practices and policies used in countries such as China, South Korea, Singapore, and Taiwan to stifle the pandemic. Unfortunately, throughout much of Europe and the United States, it is already too late to contain Covid-19 in its infancy, and policymakers are struggling to keep up with the spreading pandemic. In doing so, however, they are repeating many of the errors made early on in Italy, where the pandemic has turned into a disaster. The purpose of this article is to help U.S. and European policymakers at all levels learn from Italy’s mistakes so they can  recognize and address the unprecedented challenges presented by the rapidly expanding crisis.

世界各地的政策制定者们正在努力抗击迅速升级的新型冠状病毒流行病，他们发现自己处在一个未知的领域。 关于中国、韩国、新加坡和台湾等国家遏制这种流行病的做法和政策，已经有很多文章。 不幸的是，在整个欧洲和美国的大部分地区，控制新型冠状病毒已经为时已晚，政策制定者正在努力跟上疾病传播的步伐。 然而，在这样做的过程中，他们重复了意大利早期犯下的许多错误，那里的流行病已经演变成了一场灾难。 本文的目的是帮助美国和欧洲各级决策者从意大利的错误中吸取教训，以便他们能够认识到并应对迅速扩大的危机所带来的前所未有的挑战。

In a matter of weeks (from February 21 to March 22), Italy went from the discovery of the first official Covid-19 case to a government decree that essentially prohibited all movements of people within the whole territory, and the closure of all non-essential business activities. Within this very short time period, the country has been hit by nothing short of a tsunami of unprecedented force, punctuated by an incessant stream of deaths. It is unquestionably Italy’s biggest crisis since World War II.

在几个星期的时间里(从2月21日到3月22日) ，意大利从发现第一个官方新型冠状病毒案件变成了一项政府法令，基本上禁止了全国境内的所有人口流动，并关闭了所有非必要的商业活动。 在这非常短的时间内，这个国家遭受了前所未有的巨大海啸的袭击，不断有人死亡。 这无疑是意大利自二战以来最大的危机。

Some aspects of this crisis — starting with its timing — can undoubtedly be attributed to plain and simple sfortuna (“bad luck” in Italian) that were clearly not under the full control of policymakers. Other aspects, however, are emblematic of the profound obstacles that leaders in Italy faced in recognizing the magnitude of the threat posed by Covid-19, organizing a systematic response to it, and learning from early implementation successes — and, most importantly, failures.

毫无疑问，这场危机的某些方面(从时机开始)可以归咎于简单明了的运气(意大利语中的“厄运”) ，而这些方面显然不在政策制定者的完全控制之下。 然而，其他方面则反映出意大利领导人在认识到新型冠状病毒组织所构成威胁的严重性、组织系统性应对措施、以及从早期成功实施和最重要的失败中吸取教训等方面所面临的巨大障碍。

It is worth emphasizing that these obstacles emerged even after Covid-19 had already fully impacted in China and some alternative models for the containment of the virus (in China and elsewhere) had already been successfully implemented. What this suggests is a systematic failure to absorb and act upon existing information rapidly and effectively rather than a complete lack of knowledge of what ought to be done.

值得强调的是，这些障碍是在新型冠状病毒组织已经在中国完全受到影响，而且一些遏制病毒的替代模式(在中国和其他地方)已经成功实施之后才出现的。 这意味着系统性地未能迅速有效地吸收现有信息并对其采取行动，而不是完全不知道应该做些什么。

Here are explanations for that failure — which relate to the difficulties of making decisions in real time, when a crisis is unfolding — and ways to overcome them.

以下是对这种失败的解释，包括在危机发生时实时做出决定的困难，以及克服这些困难的方法。

**Recognize your cognitive biases.** In its early stages, the Covid-19 crisis in Italy looked nothing like a crisis. The initial state-of-emergency declarations were met by skepticism by both the public and many in policy circles — even though several scientists had been warning of the potential for a catastrophe for weeks. Indeed, in late February some notable Italian politicians engaged in public handshaking in Milan to make the point that the economy should not panic and stop because of the virus. (A week later, one of these politicians was diagnosed with Covid-19.)

**认识到你的认知偏差。** 在早期阶段，意大利的新型冠状病毒危机看起来一点也不像一场危机。 最初的紧急状态声明遭到了公众和许多政策圈人士的质疑——尽管几个星期以来，一些科学家一直在警告可能发生灾难。 事实上，在二月下旬，一些著名的意大利政治家在米兰公开握手，表明经济不应该因为病毒而恐慌和停止。 (一周后，其中一位政客被诊断出患有新型冠状病毒。)

Similar reactions were repeated across many other countries besides Italy and exemplify what behavioral scientists call confirmation bias — a tendency to seize upon information that confirms our preferred position or initial hypothesis. Threats such as pandemics that evolve in a nonlinear fashion (i.e., they start small but exponentially intensify) are especially tricky to confront because of the challenges of rapidly interpreting what is happening in real time. The most effective time to take strong action is extremely early, when the threat appears to be small — or even before there are any cases. But if the intervention actually works, it will appear in retrospect as if the strong actions were an overreaction. This is a game many politicians don’t want to play.

类似的反应在意大利以外的许多其他国家也重复出现，这证明了行为科学家所说的确认偏见---- 一种抓住证实我们首选立场或最初假设的信息的倾向。 诸如以非线性方式演变的大流行病之类的威胁(也就是说，它们开始时规模很小，但后来呈指数增长)尤其难以应对，因为实时快速解读正在发生的事情是一项挑战。 采取强有力行动的最有效时机是极早的时候，当威胁似乎很小的时候，甚至在出现任何病例之前。 但是，如果干预行动真的有效，那么回想起来，这些强有力的行动似乎是一种过度反应。 这是一个许多政客都不想玩的游戏。

The systematic inability to listen to experts highlights the trouble that leaders — and people in general — have figuring out how to act in dire, highly complex situations where there’s no easy solution. The desire to act causes leaders to rely on their gut feeling or the opinions of their inner circle. But in a time of uncertainty, it is essential to resist that temptation, and instead take the time to discover, organize, and absorb the partial knowledge that is dispersed across different pockets of expertise.

系统性地无法听取专家的意见，突显出领导者——以及普通民众——在没有简单解决方案的可怕、高度复杂的情况下，如何采取行动的问题。 行动的欲望导致领导者依赖于他们的直觉或者他们内部圈子的意见。 但在一个充满不确定性的时代，抵制这种诱惑是非常必要的，相反，要花时间去发现、组织和吸收分散在不同专业领域的部分知识。

**Avoid partial solutions.** A second lesson that can be drawn from the Italian experience is the importance of systematic approaches and the perils of partial solutions. The Italian government dealt with the Covid-19 pandemic by issuing a series of decrees that gradually increased restrictions within lockdown areas (“red zones”), which were then expanded until they ultimately applied to the entire country.

**避免部分解决方案。** 从意大利的经验中可以吸取的第二个教训是系统性办法的重要性和部分解决办法的危险性。 意大利政府通过发布一系列法令来应对新型冠状病毒流行病，逐渐加强了封锁区内的限制(“红区”) ，这些限制随后被扩大，直到最终适用于整个国家。

In normal times, this approach would probably be considered prudent and perhaps even wise. In this situation, it backfired for two reasons. First, it was inconsistent with the rapid exponential spread of the virus. The “facts on the ground” at any point in time were simply not predictive of what the situation would be just a few days later. As a result, Italy followed the spread of the virus rather than prevented it. Second, the selective approach might have inadvertently facilitated the spread of the virus. Consider the decision to initially lock down some regions but not others. When the decree announcing the closing of northern Italy became public, it touched off a massive exodus to southern Italy, undoubtedly spreading the virus to regions where it had not been present.

在正常情况下，这种方法可能会被认为是谨慎的，甚至是明智的。 在这种情况下，事与愿违有两个原因。 首先，这与病毒的快速指数式传播不一致。 任何时候的”实地事实”根本无法预测仅仅几天之后的情况。 结果，意大利跟随病毒的传播，而不是阻止它。 其次，这种选择性的方法可能在不经意间促进了病毒的传播。 考虑一下最初锁定某些区域而不是其他区域的决定。 当宣布关闭意大利北部的法令公之于众时，它引发了大规模的人口外流到意大利南部，毫无疑问地将病毒传播到那些没有病毒存在的地区。

This illustrates is what is now clear to many observers: An effective response to the virus needs to be orchestrated as a coherent system of actions taken simultaneously. The results of the approaches taken in China and South Korea underscore this point. While the public discussion of the policies followed in these countries often focuses on single elements of their models (such as extensive testing), what truly characterizes their effective responses is the multitude of actions that were taken at once. Testing is effective when it’s combined with rigorously contact tracing, and tracing is effective as long as it is combined with an effective communication system that collects and disseminates information on the movements of potentially infected people, and so forth.

这说明了许多观察家现在很清楚的一点: 对病毒的有效应对需要作为一个协调一致的系统同时采取行动。 中国和韩国采取的措施的结果强调了这一点。 虽然公众对这些国家遵循的政策的讨论往往侧重于其模式的单一要素(例如广泛的试验) ，但真正突出其有效反应的是立即采取的多种行动。 测试与严格的接触者追踪相结合是有效的，而追踪是有效的，只要它与有效的通信系统相结合，收集和传播关于潜在感染者行踪的信息，等等。

These rules also apply to the organization of the health care system itself. Wholesale reorganizations are needed within hospitals (for example, the creation of Covid-19 and non Covid-19 streams of care). In addition, a shift is urgently needed from patient-centered models of care to a community-system approach that offers pandemic solutions for the entire population (with a specific emphasis on home care). The need for coordinated actions is especially acute right now in the United States.

这些规则也适用于卫生保健系统本身的组织。 医院内部需要大规模的重组(例如，创建新型冠状病毒和非新型冠状病毒的医疗流)。 此外，迫切需要从以病人为中心的护理模式转向为全体人口提供流行病解决方案的社区系统方法(特别强调家庭护理)。 目前在美国，采取协调行动的需求尤为迫切。

**Learning is critical.** Finding the right implementation approach requires the ability to quickly learn from both successes and failures and the willingness to change actions accordingly. Certainly, there are valuable lessons to be learned from the approaches of China, South Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore, which were able to contain the contagion fairly early. But sometimes the best practices can be found just next door. Because the Italian health care system is highly decentralized, different regions tried different policy responses. The most notable example is the contrast between the approaches taken by Lombardy and Veneto, two neighboring regions with similar socioeconomic profiles.

**学习至关重要。** 找到正确的实施方法需要有能力从成功和失败中迅速学习，并愿意相应地改变行动。 当然，我们可以从中国、韩国、台湾和新加坡的做法中吸取宝贵的教训，这些国家很早就能够遏制危机蔓延。 但是有时候最好的做法就在隔壁。 由于意大利的卫生保健系统高度分散，不同地区尝试了不同的政策应对措施。 最引人注目的例子是 Lombardy 和 Veneto 采取的方法之间的对比，这两个邻近地区有着相似的社会经济背景。

Lombardy, one Europe’s wealthiest and most productive areas, has been disproportionately hit by Covid-19. As of March 26, it held the grim record of nearly 35,000 novel coronavirus cases and 5,000 deaths in a population of 10 million. Veneto, by contrast, fared significantly better, with 7,000 cases and 287 deaths in a population of 5 million, despite experiencing sustained community spread early on.

作为欧洲最富有和生产力最高的地区之一，Lombardy 受到了新型冠状病毒的不成比例的打击。 截至3月26日，它保持着近35000例新型冠状病毒病例和1000万人口中5000例死亡的可怕记录。 相比之下，威尼托的情况要好得多，在500万人口中有7000个病例和287人死亡，尽管早期经历了持续的社区传播。

The trajectories of these two regions have been shaped by a multitude of factors outside the control of policymakers, including Lombardy’s greater population density and higher number of cases when the crisis erupted. But it’s becoming increasingly apparent that different public health choices made early in the cycle of the pandemic also had an impact.

这两个地区的发展轨迹受到政策制定者无法控制的众多因素的影响，包括 Lombardy 更高的人口密度和危机爆发时更多的病例。 但是，越来越明显的是，在大流行周期早期做出的不同公共卫生选择也产生了影响。

Specifically, while Lombardy and Veneto applied similar approaches to social distancing and retail closures, Veneto took a much more proactive tack towards the containment of the virus. Veneto’s strategy was multi-pronged:

具体而言，尽管 Lombardy 和 Veneto 在社会疏远和关闭零售店方面采取了类似的做法，但威尼托在遏制病毒方面采取了更为积极的策略。 威尼托的战略是多管齐下的:

 * Extensive testing of symptomatic and asymptomatic cases early on. 早期对有症状和无症状病例的广泛检测

 * Proactive tracing of potential positives. If someone tested positive, everyone in that patient’s home as well as their neighbors were tested. If testing kits were unavailable, they were self-quarantined. 主动追踪潜在的积极因素。 如果有人检测呈阳性，那么病人家里的每个人以及他们的邻居都要接受检测。 如果测试工具不可用，他们是自我隔离

 * A strong emphasis on home diagnosis and care. Whenever possible, samples were collected directly from a patient’s home and then processed in regional and local university labs. 强调家庭诊断和护理。 只要有可能，样本都会直接从病人家中收集，然后在地区和当地大学的实验室进行处理

 * Specific efforts to monitor and protect health care and other essential workers. They included medical professionals, those in contact with at-risk populations (e.g., caregivers in nursing homes), and workers exposed to the public (e.g., supermarket cashiers, pharmacists, and protective services staff). 监测和保护卫生保健和其他基本工作人员的具体努力。 他们包括医疗专业人员、与高危人群有接触的人士(例如护养院照顾者) ，以及与公众接触的人士(例如超级市场收银员、药剂师及保护服务人员)

Following the guidance from public health authorities in the central government, Lombardy opted instead for a more conservative approach to testing. On a per capita basis, it has so far conducted half of the tests conducted in Veneto and had a much stronger focus only on symptomatic cases — and has so far made limited investments in proactive tracing, home care and monitoring, and protection of health care workers.

在中央政府公共卫生部门的指导下，Lombardy 选择了一种更为保守的检测方法。 按人均计算，迄今为止，中国已经完成了在 Veneto 进行的一半测试，而且更加注重有症状的病例ーー迄今为止，中国在主动追踪、家庭护理和监测以及保护医护人员方面的投资有限。

The set of policies enacted in Veneto are thought to have considerably reduced the burden on hospitals and minimized the risk of Covid-19 spreading in medical facilities, a problem that has greatly impacted hospitals in Lombardy. The fact that different policies resulted in different outcomes across otherwise similar regions should have been recognized as a powerful learning opportunity from the start. The findings emerging from Veneto could have been used to revisit regional and central policies early on. Yet, it is only in recent days, a full month after the outbreak in Italy, that Lombardy and other regions are taking steps to emulate some of the aspects of the “Veneto approach,” which include pressuring the central government to help them boost their diagnostic capacity.

据认为，Veneto 颁布的一系列政策大大减轻了医院的负担，降低了新型冠状病毒在医疗机构传播的风险，这个问题已经极大地影响了 Lombardy 的医院。 不同的政策导致本来相似的区域产生不同的结果，这一事实从一开始就应被视为一个强有力的学习机会。 Veneto 的调查结果本可以用来重新审视早期的地区和中央政策。 然而，直到最近几天，也就是意大利疫情爆发整整一个月之后，Lombardy 和其他地区才开始采取步骤仿效“威尼托方法”的某些方面，其中包括向中央政府施压，以帮助它们提高诊断能力。

The difficulty in diffusing newly acquired knowledge is a well-known phenomenon in both private- and the public-sector organizations. But, in our view, accelerating the diffusion of knowledge that is emerging from different policy choices (in Italy and elsewhere) should be considered a top priority at a time when “every country is reinventing the wheel,” as several scientists told us. For that to happen, especially at this time of heightened uncertainty, it is essential to consider different policies as if they were “experiments,” rather than personal or political battles, and to adopt a mindset (as well as systems and processes) that facilitates learning from past and current experiences in dealing with Covid-19 as effectively and rapidly as possible.

It is especially important to understand what does not work. While successes easily surface thanks to leaders eager to publicize progress, problems often are hidden due to fear of retribution, or, when they do emerge, they are interpreted as individual — rather than systemic — failures. For example, it emerged that at the very early onset of the pandemic in Italy (February 25), the contagion in a specific area in Lombardy could have been accelerated through a local hospital, where a Covid-19 patient was not been properly diagnosed and isolated. In talking to the media, the Italian prime minister referred to this incident as evidence of managerial inadequacy at the specific hospital. However, a month later it became clearer that the episode might have been emblematic of a much deeper issue: that hospitals traditionally organized to deliver patient-centric care are ill-equipped to deliver the type of community-focused care needed during a pandemic.

了解什么是不起作用的尤为重要。 由于领导人急于公布进展，成功很容易浮出水面，但问题往往因为害怕遭到报复而隐藏起来，或者，即使出现问题，也会被解读为个人的失败，而不是系统性的失败。 例如，在意大利大流行的早期(2月25日) ，在 Lombardy 特定地区的传染可以通过当地医院加速，那里的一名新型冠状病毒病人没有得到正确的诊断和隔离。 在接受媒体采访时，这位意大利总理称这起事件是该医院管理不善的证据。 然而，一个月之后，事情变得更加明朗，这一事件可能反映了一个更深层次的问题: 传统上组织起来以病人为中心的医院设备不足，无法提供大流行期间所需的那种以社区为重点的医疗服务。

**Collecting and disseminating data is important.** Italy seems to have suffered from two data-related problems. In the early onset of the pandemic, the problem was data paucity. More specifically, it has been suggested that the widespread and unnoticed diffusion of the virus in the early months of 2020 may have been facilitated by the lack of epidemiological capabilities and the inability to systematically record anomalous infection peaks in some hospitals.

**收集和传播数据非常重要。** 意大利似乎遭遇了两个与数据相关的问题。 在大流行的早期发病期间，问题是缺乏数据。 更具体地说，有人认为，2020年前几个月病毒的广泛和未引起注意的传播可能是由于缺乏流行病学能力以及一些医院无法系统地记录异常感染高峰而促成的。

More recently, the problem appears to be one of data precision. In particular, in spite of the remarkable effort that the Italian government has shown in regularly updating statistics relative to the pandemic on a publicly available website, some commentators have advanced the hypothesis that the striking discrepancy in mortality rates between Italy and other countries and within Italian regions may (at least in part) be driven by different testing approaches. These discrepancies complicate the management of the pandemic in significant ways, because in absence of truly comparable data (within and across countries) it is harder to allocate resources and understand what’s working where (for example, what’s inhibiting the effective tracing of the population).

最近，问题出现在数据精度上。 特别是，尽管意大利政府在公开网站上定期更新有关该大流行病的统计数据方面作出了显著努力，但一些评论员提出了一种假设，即意大利与其他国家和意大利区域内死亡率的惊人差异可能(至少部分地)是由不同的测试方法造成的。 这些差异在很大程度上使流感大流行的管理复杂化，因为缺乏真正可比的数据(国家内部和国家之间) ，就很难分配资源，也很难理解哪些因素在哪里起作用(例如，什么因素阻碍了对人口的有效跟踪)。

In an ideal scenario, data documenting the spread and effects of the virus should be as standardized as possible across regions and countries and follow the progression of the virus and its containment at both a macro (state) and micro (hospital) level. The need for micro-level data cannot be underestimated. While the discussion of health care quality is often made in terms of macro entities (countries or states), it is well known that health care facilities vary dramatically in terms of the quality and quantity of the services they provide and their managerial capabilities, even within the same states and regions. Rather than hiding these underlying differences, we should be fully aware of them and plan the allocation of our limited resources accordingly. Only by having good data at the right level of analysis can policymakers and health care practitioners draw proper inferences about which approaches are working and which are not.

在理想的情况下，记录病毒传播和影响的数据应该尽可能标准化，并在宏观(州)和微观(医院)层面跟踪病毒的进展及其遏制情况。 对微观层面数据的需求不可低估。 虽然关于保健质量的讨论往往是从宏观实体(国家或州)的角度进行的，但众所周知，即使在同一个州和地区，保健设施提供的服务的质量和数量及其管理能力也大不相同。 我们不应该掩盖这些潜在的差异，而应该充分认识到这些差异，并相应地规划我们有限资源的分配。 只有拥有适当分析水平的良好数据，政策制定者和卫生保健从业人员才能对哪些方法有效、哪些无效作出适当的推断。

## A Different Decision-Making Approach
## 一种不同的决策方法
There is still tremendous uncertainty on what exactly needs to be done to stop the virus. Several key aspects of the virus are still unknown and hotly debated, and are likely to remain so for a considerable amount of time. Furthermore, significant lags occur between the time of action (or, in many cases, inaction) and outcomes (both infections and mortality). We need to accept that an unequivocal understanding of what solutions work is likely to take several months, if not years.

目前仍然存在巨大的不确定性，不知道究竟需要采取什么措施来阻止这种病毒。 该病毒的几个关键方面仍然是未知的和激烈的辩论，并可能保持相当长的时间。 此外，在采取行动的时间(或者在许多情况下，不采取行动)和结果(感染和死亡率)之间存在显著的滞后。 我们需要接受这样一个事实，即明确理解解决方案的作用可能需要几个月，甚至几年的时间。

However, two aspects of this crisis appear to be clear from the Italian experience. First, there is no time to waste, given the exponential progression of the virus. As the head of the Italian Protezione Civile (the Italian equivalent of FEMA) put it, “The virus is faster than our bureaucracy.” Second, an effective approach towards Covid-19 will require a war-like mobilization — both in terms of the entity of human and economic resources that will need to be deployed as well as the extreme coordination that will be required across different parts of the health care system (testing facilities, hospitals, primary care physicians, etc.), between different entities in both the public and the private sector, and society at large.

然而，从意大利的经验来看，这场危机的两个方面似乎很明显。 首先，考虑到病毒的指数级增长，没有时间可以浪费。 正如意大利 Protezione Civile (意大利相当于联邦应急管理局)的负责人所说，“病毒比我们的官僚机构还要快。” 其次，要想有效地解决新型冠状病毒问题，需要进行战争式的动员ーー不仅需要部署人力和经济资源，还需要在公共部门、私营部门和整个社会的不同实体之间，在卫生保健系统的不同部分(检测设施、医院、初级保健医生等)进行极端的协调。

Together, the need for immediate action and for massive mobilization imply that an effective response to this crisis will require a decision-making approach that is far from business as usual. If policymakers want to win the war against Covid-19, it is essential to adopt one that is systemic, prioritizes learning, and is able to quickly scale successful experiments and identify and shut down the ineffective ones. Yes, this a tall order — especially in the midst of such an enormous crisis. But given the stakes, it has to be done.

总之，立即采取行动和大规模动员的必要性意味着，要对这场危机作出有效反应，就需要采取远非一切照旧的决策办法。 如果政策制定者想要赢得对抗新型冠状病毒组织的战争，就必须采用一种系统性的方法，优先考虑学习，能够迅速扩大成功的实验规模，识别并关闭无效的实验。 是的，这是一项艰巨的任务ーー尤其是在如此巨大的危机之中。 但考虑到利害关系，我们必须这么做。
